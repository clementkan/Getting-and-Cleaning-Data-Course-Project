## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains my submission for the course project for Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" course by Johns Hopkins University.

### Overview
This course project serves to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare a tidy data that can be used for subsequent analysis.

### This repository includes the following files
1. **README.md**: The file you are reading right now. It contains information about the project, and explains how all the files and script work together.
2. **run_analysis.R**: Contains the R script that performs all the operations, from data collection through creating the tidy data set.
3. **tidy_dataset.txt**: Contains the processed data that results from running the run_analysis.R code file.
4. **CodeBook.md**: This codebook contains detailed description about the variables, data and transformations work that I have performed to create the tidy data set.

### Course instructions (extracted from the course webpage)
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example [this article](http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/). Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) where the data was obtained. 

[The data for the project is available here.](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

##### You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##### Review criteria:
1. The submitted data set is tidy.
2. The Github repo contains the required scripts.
3. GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
4. The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.
5. The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.
